    National and economic well being

> cyberspace important to infrastructure
> DSCI framework for commmitment to open and secure cyber
> global and open nature of the internet brings threats
> NIST framework for private sector
> NIST cyber is an action orientated framework. 
> Framwork core: set of activities to achive certain areas.
> Implimentation tiers: 1. Patial implementation (ad hoc and reactive) not based on risk        objectives. 2: Risk informed, informal sharing of cyber internally not repeated externally.     4: LIke the last but also compared externally.
> Frame work profile provides a view of risk by combining busdiness outocmes with Cyber         activities.
> Framwork Funtion subdivision: Each of the NIST functions have subcatagories, containing a totoal of 20 possible actions
> Freamwork function can also be referred to as security plan
> Implementation of NIST: 
    1. Identify business outocmes
    2. Understand threats and vulnerabilities
    3. create current profile
    4. conduct a risk assessment
    5. Decide on the target profile

    Risk

> Cyber risks related to business. (managing risk)

> Can refer to NIST SP 800-30 guide for conducting risk assessments 
> also can use ISO 27005, information security risk management  

> Risk of attacking is calculated by a lot of factors such as: 
> Money 
> Inelegance
> Risk assessment, finding the weak points within a business e.g. computers, servers, or        other devices connected to the network. 

> Maybe if the server is kept in the underneath of the building it would be vulnerable to a     flooding event. 

> A server that has no emergency power supply may be vulnerable to a power outage event. 

NOTE: The difference between these two risks and compared to the risk of e.g. a website being hacked is that if a server gets flooded it will be down for weeks, if a website gets hacked it could be down for weeks but will most likely just be annoying to fix. This is risk assessment, assessing where the biggest risks lie and how likely they are to happen.

    Continuation of DSS05

    3) DSSO5.01
        >  Protect against malware, make sure to cover all possible aspects of protection.
            - ensure security of network against malware
                1) Install and activate malicious software detection and prevention         tools
                        ~ Make sure malware definition files are updated, with all the 
                          Malware Is related to your systems vulnerabilities
                2) Filter incoming traffic e.g. downloads and emails and detect any implantation malware.
    4) DSS05.02
        >  Manage network and connectivity security
            - Monitor all network connection gateways and protect all information being transferred in and out
            - Implement network filtering systems 
                1) Perimeter network filtering
                2) internal network zoning 
    5) DSSO5.03
        > Manage endpoint security
            - Make Sure endpoints are secured with the same security as what is running on the main network or a higher level of security. never lower.
                ~ e.g. if the network is running windows 7 firewall all endpoints need to use windows 7 firewall or a higher level firewall.
            - Malicious software detection 
            - Filter incoming traffic
                ~ can stop things like phishing emails or spyware embedded in email containing documents 
            - Implement firewalls and intrusion prevention systems 
            - Network zoning can protect information 
            - Data Loss prevention is support
    6) DSS05.04
        > Manage user identity and logical access
            - Usually the biggest project within the security program
            - Make sure all users have permission to access and be denied access.
            - Make sure one person can access and edit/create/delete permission files
            - When staff member leaves organization their permission and accounts will 
                be deactivated.
            - Each person needs specified access permissions, so if in case there is a 
                problem it can be traced back to an exact person
            - NIST also has the same protocol based under the protection category
    7) DSS05.05
        > Manage Physical access to IT
            - 
    8) DSS05.06
        > Manage sensitive documents and output devices
    9) DSS05.07
        > Monitor infrastructure for security-related events
            - Use of intrusion detection tools and monitor the infrastructure

    Framework controls

    > Mitigate risks
    > Value of cyber controls is the difference between the accessed impact of a cyber attack and the cost of controls required to protect against it.
    > Inherent risk is the risk at hand once it has been dealt with there is usually a smaller risk leftover know as residual risk
    > COntrols can mitigate risk by deterring attack, preventing an attack, detecting an attack and correcting an attack
    > Important when building a control strategy to combine controls for the most likely to succeed defense 
    > Multi tier control strat 
    > Access control: anyone trying to assecc is deterred unless authorized. 
    > Government policy 
    > PCI data security
    > Critical infrastructure all are external security implementations

        >  3.1: 12 technical operational areas 
            - effective firewall config standard
            
        PCI DSS Requirements

        > Configure firewall setting, mobile devices as well included 
        > Change default password and settings 
        > Protect stored cardholder stat, not card data can be stored, not even in hashed form
        > encrypt transmission across any networks 
        > Must implement antiviruses, regular scans must be taken
        > Maintain secure system and applications attention for SQl injections. 
        > Maintain an information security policy. 

    > ATMS and card readers are targeted by scammers, the summer reads any card put into the machine.

    > Cyber essentials use existing standards (ISO and NIST) it's just cheaper. 
    > Stage one, submit self assessment for external review
    > Requires evidence of security across 5 groups

        1. Boundary defence 
        2. Secure Configuration 
        3. User access control
        4. Malware protection 
        5. Patch management 

    > Designed to ensure protection from internet facilitated attacks
    > Boundary firewalls and internet gateways 
        - Admin password must be changed

    Cyber attack

    > Mostly from organized criminals and state funded agents
    > Cyber kill chain
        1. Reconnaissance: Getting information about target
            - Targeting a business we will start with a known inter (website) address and then scan it to find other targets within the business. Using (nmap usually) for port scanning individual machines within a business.
            - Using a botnet (people computers hacked to hackers and use the PC resources) hackers will usually carry out automated scans.
        2. Weaponization: Can be purchased
        3. Delivery: Most common way of delivery can be via downloadable .txt document 
            - Can be delivered via hacked website
        4. Exploitation: email, web and usb based attacks packet will auto open 
        5. Installation: Hacker will then use the open packet to drop a payload into system
        6. COmmands and control: The malware may be designed to accept the hacker to remotely access it to update or rebuild it in order for the payload to continue running for prolonged periods of time
        7. Actions: Hack may want to deface a website, agent may want to steal information or cyber criminal may want to take bank account details.
